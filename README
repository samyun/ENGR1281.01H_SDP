This is a git containing the code for the software design project for the FEH class at Ohio State in Autumn 2013. 

The code is to be loaded onto a Proteus microcontroller with a Vishay TSSOP2240 IR receiver. The Proteus also has a ButtonBoard attached at one of the grids. The code must perform the following tasks:

-Display a welcome message and wait for the middle button to be pressed.
-Once the middle button is pressed, sample frequencies continuously.
-Display the frequencies. 
-When middle button is pressed again, stop sampling, display a closing message. 

The code must have the following requirements:

-1ms delay each time digital input pin connected to the IR receiver is read. 
-1 of 5 frequencies will be displayed. The frequencies randomly cycle and are held for 5 seconds:
	*25Hz
	*40Hz
	*65Hz
	*80Hz
	*110Hz
-The display must not lag behind more than 1 frequency set.
-Detection must occur with the sensor held no closer than 6 inches from the beacon. 
-The transmitted frequencies are held to about +- 3%
